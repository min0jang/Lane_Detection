images files in 'camera_cal' folder are for the calibration of camera --the first step of lane detection.

An example video that you can run is posted as 'project_video.mp4', and an output is posted as 'project_video_output.mp4'.

Before running your own video, make sure you adjust 'src' and 'dst' in function 'process_img'. It changes the expected location of the lane in the image.
